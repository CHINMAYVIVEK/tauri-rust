# Tauri-Rust

## Desktop Development using Tauri (Next.JS + Rust)

This project demonstrates how to develop a desktop application using Tauri, combining the power of Next.js for the frontend and Rust for the backend.

### Features

- **Tauri**: A framework for building tiny, fast binaries for all major desktop platforms.
- **Project Structure using CLI**: Organized project structure using Tauri's CLI tools.
- **Desktop App**: Develop and build cross-platform desktop applications.
- **Concepts**: Learn the essential concepts of integrating Next.js with Rust in a Tauri application.

## Concepts

- **Tauri**: Uses a Rust backend to manage system-level operations and interactions while leveraging modern web technologies for the frontend.
- **Next.js**: Provides a powerful and flexible framework for building the frontend with React.
- **Rust**: Ensures performance and safety for backend operations in the desktop application.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js and Yarn**: Ensure you have Node.js and Yarn installed for managing the frontend dependencies.
- **Rust**: Ensure you have Rust installed for the backend.

## Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

2. **Run the Tauri Development Server**:
